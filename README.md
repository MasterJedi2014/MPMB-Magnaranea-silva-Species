# MPMB Magnaranea silva Species
This script adds a species of sapient telepathic mammalian giant tarantula to the sheets. This version has been fully updated to the 2024 species rules.

## Introduction:
While the succubus/incubus species is the first species I posted, this species of tarantula is actually the first species I designed, but it has been in development hell for about 4 years. This lengthy development time was primarily the result of needing to wrangle the original design idea down into something at least somewhat balanced, which I think I have done. However, just because I am posting the species doesn't mean that its development is complete. There are still many slight variations on what I am releasing here today that I still need to playtest.

Like my succubus/incubus species, this species was originally playtested with a Life Cleric, but instead of a standalone PC, the original playtest character was a companion character to a half-elf Artificer. I have since playtested a handful of other times with various builds of this species, sometimes as standalone PCs, sometimes as NPCs. The current build uses the "Lineage" idea from the 5.24/5.5E species to replace a previously rather convoluted method of spell gain, which has greatly helped in wrangling this species into something that isn't *as* easily able to become an overpowered nightmare in the hands of a malicious player.

Another of my means of bringing this species into some semblance of balance is near-complete rule replacements as a result of the spider body plan. For example, members of this species require expensive specially made weapons & armor, and their only reliable means of interacting with anything designed for Humanoids is the Mage Hand cantrip that they are given.

Due to the odd nature of this species, I do not have a "Detect Balance" score breakdown table for this species like I did for the succubus/incubus species.

# Species Information:
## General Description:
Generally regarded by those who know them well as enigmatic guardians of the forest and of those in need, this a species of enormous tarantulas. Some say that Magnaranea are yet another product of wizards messing with forces they shouldn't, others say that Magnaranea are nature's answer to continued encroachment by civilization. Only the Magnaranea's oldest members know the true answer, and they have stubbornly kept the answer to themselves.

**Author Note** This species is still under active (but slow) development, and is provided as is for now.

### Physical Description:
Members of this species have a brown and pale yellow coloration. *Aphonopelma chalcodes* tarantulas will give a better idea of their coloration, if you feel up to looking for a picture.

Members of this species are considered an adult once they reach about 200 years old, reaching a fully grown size of about 20m (\~65.6') in diameter and about 10m (\~32.8') in height. Despite this, they mentally develop at about the same rate or faster than humans do, reaching mental maturity (according to most humanoids, anyway) between the ages of 16-21. However, *M. silva*'s different brain structure & cultural values means that *M. silva* are usually considered to have mentally matured by other *M. silva* around the age of 50-60. Around that age, *M. silva* are usually about 3-4m (9.8-13’) in diameter, giving them a size classification of Large. *M. silva* have a normal lifespan of about 700-1000 years.

Unlike most Earth arachnids, males and females of *M. silva* aren't very different in terms of size or coloration.

The hair on *M. silva*'s legs is soft to the touch. The hair on their bodies is a mixture of soft hair strands and hair strands that are very irritating to the skin of most creatures. The irritating hair strands are normally covered up by the longer and more plentiful soft hair strands, but can be raised to protrude through the softer hair when they feel threatened.

To accommodate their large size, the internal physiology of *M. silva* is more like a mammal's than a normal arachnid. For example, *M. silva* possess internal skeletons to support their weight, their exoskeletons having either been converted into chitin armor plating or being completely lost in some places and replaced by tough but smooth skin. *M. silva* can use the hairs they use for climbing to "grasp" objects, and the tips of their legs and pedipalps have three short chitin claws on them that can, for example, be used for plucking strings. These claws are too blunt to be used as weapons on members smaller than 10m in diameter.

Additionally, two of *M. silva*’s eight eyes have adapted to be able to operate normally in daylight conditions with dichromatic vision. Some rare *M. silva* members have trichromatic vision in these eyes. The other six eyes are also able to operate in daylight conditions, but only have monochromatic vision and are better suited for low-light conditions. *M. silva* eyes do have pupils, but they are very basic and cannot dilate or contract enough to adequately serve the function of regulating the amount of light entering their eyes. All eight eyes have eyelids, which is *M. silva*’s main method of regulating the amount of light entering the eyes.

Members of *M. silva* do require sleep, though they only need to sleep for about five hours a day under normal circumstances. This can be done in one sitting or as naps spread out across the day.

Unlike most arachnids, female *M. silva* keep their fertilized eggs within their bodies until they hatch, effectively giving birth to live young. When they feel safe enough to do so this is their preferred method of bearing their young, but the *M. silva* species does still have the ability to make eggs sacks to keep their eggs in if they do not feel safe enough to use the previous method. *M. silva* clutches (spider version of a litter of kittens) typically only number 20 at most, with the norm being closer to 5-8. Their eggs are typically brown barely translucent spheres with a tough yet smooth skin about .375m (~1.25') in diameter. Gestation period for *M. silva* eggs is normally about 3.5-4 Earth months. *M. silva* usually become reproductively mature enough to sire/bear offspring around the ages of 80-100, though most don't have children until much later in their lives. 

### Behavioral Description:
Members of *M. silva* are generally easy going, but are also fiercely protective of those they consider friends, family, or those under their protection. Most are smart enough to know when and/or how to pick their fights. They usually get satisfaction out of being helpful to others. Most *M. silva* live as protectors of forests, mountains, or grasslands, using their size, webbing, and magic abilities to protect those areas, though some choose to live as wanderers who explore the world. Those protecting natural areas will freely allow hunters to hunt wildlife in said area as long as the hunting doesn’t pose a risk of killing out a significant amount of the wildlife in the area. *M. silva* normally live peacefully in large groups consisting of about 50-100 members. Despite their normally gentle nature, most *M. silva* avoid large cities and towns for their own safety, as they know that many people are afraid of arachnids. Some large cities and towns are exempt from this avoidance behavior, usually because said cities/towns were/are under the protection of one or more groups of *M. silva* when said cities/towns were much younger and smaller.

As they grow up, most *M. silva* learn to use magic spells from older members in their groups or local magic users. As mentioned earlier, these magic spells are usually only used for the defense of themselves or others.

### Languages:
Most *M. silva* can understand Common, Elven, and Dwarvish & can speak them telepathically. They do not have an innate knowledge of these languages and have to learn them the same way humans, elves, etc have to. All *M. silva* have an innate basic knowledge of a language that can be used to communicate with other arachnids.

### Names:
*M. silva* claim a wide variety of names when dealing with non-arachnids, usually pertaining to predominant nearby culture. They do have names given to them by their parents in their Arachnid tongue, which is comprised of soft/hard clicks, chirps, and trills, but these Arachnid names generally don't have direct translations in Common. *M. silva* sometimes go by a nickname given to them by another species.

When you reach character levels 3 and 5, you learn a higher-level spell, as shown on the table. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.<br>
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage).
##### Forest Guardian Lineages
| Lineage           | Level 1 | Level 3 | Level 5 |
|:-----------------:|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| Clerical Guardian | You know the *Spare the Dying* cantrip. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace that cantrip with a different cantrip from the Cleric spell list.<br>You also know the *Mage Hand* cantrip; it cannot be replaced with another cantrip. | *Ceremony* | Your choice of *Borrowed Knowledge* or *Prayer of Healing*. This choice is permanent. |
| Druidic Guardian  | You know the *Druidcraft* cantrip. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace that cantrip with a different cantrip from the Druid spell list.<br>You also know the *Mage Hand* cantrip; it cannot be replaced with another cantrip. | *Speak with Animals* | Your choice of *Darkvision* or *Wither and Bloom*. This choice is permanent. |

***No Hands.*** Your limbs and pedipalps have cling pads and three relatively small retractable claws (<5cm(2”) at age 60), allowing you to use weapons and other objects made for Humanoids, but you may not add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls with any Humanoid weapons you use. In order to add your Proficiency Bonus from Weapon Training to attack rolls, you must acquire weapons specially made for your body plan. Weapons provided with your starting gear are already considered to have been specially made for your body plan.<br>
New weapons made for your body plan cost 50% more than they otherwise would. Magical weapons instead cost an extra 50% of the base weapon type per rarity of magical weapon.<br>
Until the age of 200, any specially made gear for you will have to be adjusted every year to account for your larger size if you wish to keep using that gear, requiring a cost equal to 10% of the gear’s crafting/purchase price.

***Natural Chitin Armor.*** You have some natural chitin armor, enough to give you a base AC of 14. Due to your arachnid body, you cannot equip normal armor. Your base AC will rise by one (1) every 35 years over the age of 60 you are, capping out at an unarmored AC of 18 at the age of 200.<br>
Any armor that would give you extra AC will be very rare or very expensive custom made armor. Such armor will costs four times the equivalent armor made for Humanoids, and it weighs twice as much. Magical armor increases in price to accommodate your body plan from the standard magical armor price by an amount equal to three times the cost of a non-magical set of the base armor.<br>
Until the age of 200, any specially made gear for you will have to be adjusted every year to account for your larger size if you wish to keep using that gear, requiring a cost equal to 10% of the gear’s crafting/purchase price.<br>
*Alternate Rules:* At character levels 4, 8, 12, & 16, your AC rises by one (1) up to a maximum AC of 18.

***The Bigger You Are.*** Strength stat will automatically rise by one (1) for every 35 yrs over the age of 60 you are until you reach the age of 200.<br>
*Alternate Rules:* At character levels 4, 8, 12, & 16, your Strength stat rises by one (1). This will not occur past 16th level.

***Natural Resilience.*** For each level past character level 1, the HP to be added to your HP pool will be rolled with advantage if you choose to roll. Furthermore, regardless of your chosen class, you use d8s as your Hit Die.<br>
*Possible Alternate Rules: Regardless of your chosen class, you use d10s as your Hit Die **(Need playtesting).***

***Size Calculation.*** *M. silva* characters will need to keep track of their diameter, as it will increase as they get older until they are about 200 yrs old. Adult *M. silva* are usually between 18-22m (59-72’) in diameter. This is well into the Gargantuan creature size category, which is likely unplayable for a companion or player character in most campaigns. Unless the DM allows companions or PCs of this size, there must therefore be an upper bound on the age of the average companion or player M. silva character.<br>
For every 8.5 years past the age of 60, the diameter of an avaerage *M. silva* character will increase by about one meter (\~3’). In order to keep companion and player *M. silva* characters from reaching Gargantuan size, the max age for non-NPC M. silva characters is within 5 years of 85.5 years of age. Average *M. silva* members will be about 6m (\~20’) in diameter, the threshold of the Gargantuan creature size category, by the age of 85.5, hence this value for the max age.<br>
This age limit will change depending on the adult size of the *M. silva* character, but the absolute minimum diameter of an adult *M. silva* is 14m (\~46’). To calculate the age limit for an *M. silva* character of any size, the general formula is as follows:

140 yrs / ([Adult diameter (14-26m)] – [Age 60 diameter (2-4m)]) = [yrs/meter]<br>
(6 meters – [Age 60 diameter (2-4m)]) * [yrs/meter] = Age limit + 60 yrs

Example max age calculation for an *M. silva* player or companion character with an adult diameter of 14m and a diameter at the age of 60 of 2m:

140 yrs / (14m – 2m) => 140 yrs / 12m = 11.6667 yrs/meter<br>
(6m – 2m) * 11.6667 yrs/m => 4m * 11.6667 yrs/m = 46.6667 yrs + 60 yrs = 106.6667 yrs
